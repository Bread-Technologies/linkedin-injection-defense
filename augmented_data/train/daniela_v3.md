About
I'm a creative who loves turning ideas into reality, whether that's through writing, visuals, or strategy. I'm focused on building experience across copywriting, outreach, and digital communication.

I enjoy projects that mix structure with creativity, where I can write, organize, and create all at once. My background blends the analytical with the artistic, and I try to bring a balance of both into every project.
