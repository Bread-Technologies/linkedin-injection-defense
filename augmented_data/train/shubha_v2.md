About
A few years ago, I started out as an SEO content writer — spending hours finding the right keywords, optimizing pages, and tracking rankings.

It worked. But something always felt missing.

People were reading… yet not connecting.

That's when it clicked — growth isn't just about traffic. It's about starting real conversations with the right people.

So, I shifted gears.

I began focusing on content strategy and engagement, helping founders and marketers build trust through authentic interactions — not just posts.

Now, I'm building something that helps founders and marketers engage smarter, not louder — using AI to find and join meaningful conversations that align with their brand. 
(Still early days, but it's shaping up to be something I wish I had years ago.)

Now, as a solopreneur, I'm building, experimenting, and sharing what I learn along the way — from content systems to community growth across social platforms.

If you're a founder, creator, or marketer trying to build authority and real engagement, let's connect — maybe we can learn a thing or two from each other. 🚀
