About
Hi all! I'm a dedicated and driven sales representative at Vanta, where I help clients navigate the complexities of security and compliance with confidence. I thrive in environments that challenge me to think critically, build lasting relationships, and contribute to the success of my team and clients.

Outside of my professional life, I'm passionate about giving back to my community as a volunteer at Red Cross shelters, where I support those in need during times of crisis. Whether it's assisting with shelter operations or offering a compassionate ear, I find fulfillment in helping others during difficult moments.

I believe in the power of collaboration, learning from every experience, and always striving to be better—both professionally and personally. I'm excited about the future and look forward to continuing to grow, while making meaningful contributions along the way.
