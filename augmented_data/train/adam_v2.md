About
Hi Adam here, I'm a Senior Consultant at UMATR focusing on Data & AI across the United States.

With over 4 years of professional experience in the Technology recruitment industry, my mission is to innovate talent acquisition through data-driven insights and AI applications. At UMATR, I'm dedicated to connecting groundbreaking tech companies with top-tier talent, aligning my efforts with the organisation's forward-thinking culture and commitment to excellence.

The UMATR Group was born out of the desire of putting people back at the centre, and create a platform to inspire confidence and spark creativity. Since the founding in early 2021, UMATR has expanded to offices in the UK and Dubai, and we now work across 25 countries.
